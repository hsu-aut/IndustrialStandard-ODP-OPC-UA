# OPC UA Ontology-Design-Pattern

#A simplified Ontology to describe OPC UA Servers and their nodeset
*Disclaimer: Credit to fortiss and their OpcUaNodeset-Ontology (https://github.com/OntoUA/ua-nodeset-core-ont). This ontology is based on theirs we just edited a couple of things because we are using this ontology in an execution environment*

Full documentation of the changes compared to the full OpcUaNodeset ontology coming soon...
- moved inverse object properties under same super properties as the property they belong to
- hierarchicaReferences was inverse to itself this is better done with setting it to be symmetric
